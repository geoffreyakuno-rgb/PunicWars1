  <img src="images/second-punic.jpg" alt="Hannibal crossing the Alps">
  <p>The Second Punic War is renowned for Hannibal Barca’s daring crossing of the Alps and his victories against Rome in Italy. Despite early triumphs, Rome’s persistence eventually led to victory under Scipio Africanus.</p>

  <h2>Key Battles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trebia River (218 BCE):</strong> Hannibal’s first major victory in Italy.</li>
    <li><strong>Lake Trasimene (217 BCE):</strong> Massive ambush and Roman defeat.</li>
    <li><strong>Cannae (216 BCE):</strong> Hannibal’s tactical masterpiece; Rome’s worst defeat.</li>
    <li><strong>Zama (202 BCE):</strong> Scipio Africanus defeats Hannibal, ending the war.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>Carthage lost Spain, most of its army and navy, and became a client state under Roman oversight. Rome solidified its supremacy in the western Mediterranean.</p>
