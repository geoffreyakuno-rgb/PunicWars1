  <h1>First Punic War (264–241 BCE)</h1>
  <img src="images/first-punic.jpg" alt="First Punic War Map">
  <p>The First Punic War was fought between the Roman Republic and the Carthaginian Empire over control of Sicily and Mediterranean dominance. Initially, Rome lacked a navy, but adapted quickly, creating ships equipped with the <em>corvus</em> boarding bridge that allowed their infantry to board enemy vessels.</p>

  <h2>Major Naval Battles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Battle of Mylae (260 BCE):</strong> Rome’s first major naval victory using the corvus.</li>
    <li><strong>Battle of Cape Ecnomus (256 BCE):</strong> One of history’s largest naval battles; enabled Rome’s invasion of Africa.</li>
    <li><strong>Battle of the Aegates Islands (241 BCE):</strong> Decisive Roman victory ending the war.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>Carthage ceded Sicily, paid indemnities, and lost naval supremacy. Rome became the dominant naval power of the Western Mediterranean.</p>
